# Travel-template
 I created a travel template using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
 This static template elegantly presents destinations with attractive images and a neat layout. 
 Details are highlighted by thoughtful color and font choices, giving users an inspiring vision for their future adventures. 
 My work embodies functional simplicity while capturing the essence of discovery and exploration.
