## Project: Travel Template

**Travel Template** is a static website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, created to elegantly present travel destinations.

## Security Considerations

### 1. **No User Data Handling**
- This is a purely static site: it does **not** collect, store, or transmit user data.
- No forms or dynamic interactions that involve sensitive information are present.

### 2. **Static Content**
- All assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images) are served as static files.
- There is no interaction with third-party APIs or external services that could introduce security risks.

### 3. **JavaScript Safety**
- JavaScript is used only for basic client-side behavior and visual effects.
- No use of `eval()`, dynamic script injection, or risky DOM manipulation methods.

### 4. **Content Integrity**
- Ensure files are hosted on secure platforms with proper permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- All external libraries (if used) should come from trusted CDNs and be checked for integrity (using SRI hashes if applicable).

## Future Improvements

- Make the template responsive using modern CSS techniques (media queries, flexbox/grid)
- Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers when hosting to limit execution of unauthorized scripts
- Offer a dark/light mode toggle with local storage (non-invasive)

## Disclaimer

**Travel Template** is intended as a static presentation tool. It does not include advanced security features because it does not handle sensitive interactions or server communication. Users who integrate the template into larger projects should implement additional security based on their specific context.
